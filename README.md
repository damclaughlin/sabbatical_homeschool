Summary report from 2013 sabbatical &amp; homeschooling

The Word document represents a summarized view after eight weeks of homeschooling.  Many thoughts & ideas came from the following sources (which I recommend):

“There are No Shortcuts”, Rafe Esquith
“Smart but Scattered”, Peg Dawson & Richard Guare
“Confident Parenting”, Jim Burns
“The Way They Learn”, Cynthia Ulrich Tobias
“How to Read A Book”, Mortimer J. Adler & Charles Van Doren
“Father, Son, 3-Mile Run”, Keith J. Leenhouts
